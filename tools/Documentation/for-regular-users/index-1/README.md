# Getting Started

If you're opening this, you're probably in front of a freshly unboxed LRR instance. 

To get started, I recommend checking and editing your Settings before uploading any files.

{% page-ref page="first-steps.md" %}

After populating the app with a few archives, you should get something that looks like this.

You can then get right to reading your stuff:

{% page-ref page="archives.md" %}

As well as import metadata using Plugins:

{% page-ref page="metadata.md" %}
