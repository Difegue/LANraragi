# Themes

The front-end interface of LANraragi is customizable out of the box through CSS.  
A few themes are built-in already. Theme Preference is saved on a per-user basis.

To change Theme, click the matching button on the footer of every page.  
You can write your own themes by modifying the existing ones - Dropping them in the _/public/themes_ folder will make them selectable by anyone.

For Docker/Vagrant Users who don't have access to the app folder and want to make custom themes, your only option currently is to either build your own Docker image, or use a custom CSS browser extension.
