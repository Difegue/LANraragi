# 📂 Categories

Categories appear in the archive index as shortcut buttons.

![Example categories](<../.screenshots/favtags.jpg>)

There are two distinct kinds:

* 📁 Static Categories are arbitrary collections of Archives, where you can add as many items as you want.
* ⚡ Dynamic Categories contain all archives matching a given predicate, and automatically update alongside your library.

Toggling a category in the index will restrict all your searches to that category, for as long as it is toggled. If you have a lot of categories, the most recently used will appear first in the list.  
**📌Pinned** Categories will always show first.

To create categories, you can use the dedicated setting page in the app:

![Category creation page](../.screenshots/categories.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have an existing folder hierarchy for your Archives, LRR can automatically create categories from said hierarchy through the dedicated utility Script.

Look for it in Plugin Configuration.
{% endhint %}
