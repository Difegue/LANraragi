description: Organize your archives in dynamic or static categories.

# Categories

Categories appear in the archive index as shortcut buttons.  

![Example categories](../.gitbook/assets/favtags.jpg)

 There are two distinct kinds:

*  üìÅ Static Categories are arbitrary collections of Archives, where you can add as many items as you want.
*  ‚ö° Dynamic Categories contain all archives matching a given predicate, and automatically update alongside your library.

Toggling a category in the index will restrict all your searches to that category, for as long as it is toggled.

To create categories, you can use the dedicated setting page in the app:

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have an existing folder hierarchy for your Archives, LRR can automatically create categories from said hierarchy through the dedicated utility Script. 

Look for it in Plugin Configuration.
{% endhint %}
