# Architecture & Style

## Installation Script

The _install.pl_ script is essentially a sequence of commands executed to install the backend and frontend dependencies needed to run LRR, as well as basic environment checks.

## Specific environment variables you can apply to change LRR behavior

Those variables were introduced for the Homebrew package, but they can be declared at anytime on any type of install; LRR will try to use them.  

* `LRR_DATA_DIRECTORY` - Data directory override. If this variable is set to a path, said path will house the content folder. If the user modifies the location of the content folder in his settings, the override has no effect on the content folder.  
* `LRR_TEMP_DIRECTORY` - Temporary directory override. If this variable is set to a path, the temporary folder will be there instead of `/public/temp`.
* `LRR_LOG_DIRECTORY` - Log directory override. Changes the location of the `log` folder.  
* `LRR_FORCE_DEBUG` - Debug Mode override. This will force Debug Mode to be enabled regardless of the user setting.
* `LRR_NETWORK` - Network Interface. See the dedicated page in Advanced Operations.  

## Coding Style

While Perl's mantra is "There's more than one way to do it", I try to make LRR follow the PBP, aka Perl Best Practices.  
This is done by the use of the [Perl::Critic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic) module, which reports PBP violations.  
If installed, you can run the critic on the entire LRR source tree through the `npm run critic` shortcut command.  
Critic is automatically run on evert commit made to LRR at the level 5 thanks to [Github Actions](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/blob/dev/.github/main.workflow).

I also run [perltidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PerlTidy) on the source tree every now and then for consistency.

```

## Background Worker Architecture

The Shinobu Background Worker runs in parallel of the LRR Mojolicious Server and handles various tasks repeatedly:

* Scanning the content folder for new archives using inotify watches
* Adding new archives and executing Plugins on them if enabled
* Regenerates the JSON cache when metadata or archive count changes

It's a second process spawned through the Proc::Background Perl Module.

## About the Search Cache

When you perform a search in LRR, that search is saved to a cache in order to be served faster the next time it's queried.  
This cache is busted as soon as the archive index is modified in any way.(be it editing metadata or adding/removing archives)

## Behaviour in Debug Mode

In Debug Mode, the Mojolicious server auto-restarts on every file modification.  
You also get access to the Mojolicious logs in LRR's built-in Log View. More logs are also published when in Debug mode.

## Database Architecture

You can look inside the LRR Redis database at any moment through the `redis-cli` tool.

The base architecture is as follows:

```text
-Redis Database
|- **************************************** <- 40-character long ID for every logged archive
|  |- tags <- Saved tags
|  |- name <- Name of the archive file, kept for filesystem checks
|  |- title <- Title of the archive, as set by the User
|  |- file <- Filesystem path to archive
|  |- isnew <- Whether the archive has been opened in LRR once or not
|  +- thumbhash <- SHA-1 hash of the first image of the archive
|
|- LRR_CONFIG <- Configuration keys, usually set through the LRR Configuration page.
|  |- tempmaxsize  
|  |- autotag  
|  |- blacklist  
|  |- devmode  
|  |- readorder  
|  |- motd
|  |- pagesize  
|  |- dirname  
|  |- htmltitle
|  |- apikey
|  |- fav1/5 <- Favorite tags, if set by the user.
|  +- enablepass <- Enable/Disable Password Authentication.
|
+- LRR_SEARCHCACHE <- Search Cache
   |- $columnfilter-$filter-$sortkey-$sortorder-$newonly <- Unique ID for a search. The search result is serialized and saved as the value for this ID.
   +- --title-asc-0 <- Example ID for a search made on titles with no filters.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The archive IDs computed by LRR are created by taking the first 500KBs of the file, and computing a SHA-1 hash from this data.

You can find the code used for the calculation in _LANraragi::Utils::Database_.
