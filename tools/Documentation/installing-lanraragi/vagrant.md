  Windows 7 and 8), Vagrant allows you to quickly get started nonetheless.

# Vagrant \(Deprecated\)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Vagrant installs are **deprecated** as of 0.6.0. They'll work, but come with enough potential issues and slowdowns that I don't recommend you use them at all! 
{% endhint %}

### Using the Vagrantfile

You can use the available Vagrantfile with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to deploy a virtual machine on your computer with LANraragi preinstalled.

{% hint style="info" %}
This method requires [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to be installed on your machine!
{% endhint %}

Download the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/tree/dev/tools/VagrantSetup) that's relevant to the version of LANraragi that you want to install, then move it to your future LANraragi folder. If you downloaded the nightly Vagrantfile, be sure to remove `_nightly` from the end of the filename. Once you've done that, open a terminal in that folder and enter the following commands:

```text
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up
```

Once the Vagrant machine is up and provisioned, you can access LANraragi at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
Archives you upload will be placed in the directory of the Vagrantfile.

The Vagrant machine is a simple Docker wrapper, so the database will also be stored in this directory. \(As database.rdb\)

You can use `vagrant halt` to stop the VM when you're done.  
To start it up again, use the following commands:

```text
vagrant up
vagrant provision
```

Keep in mind that the Vagrant setup, just like Docker, will always use the latest release.

### Updating

From the directory where the Vagrantfile is located:

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant provision
```

Those two commands will update the wrapped Docker image to the latest one\(basically automatically doing the commands written up there on the Docker section\). No other operations are needed.
