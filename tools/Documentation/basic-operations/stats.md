## Metrics

LANraragi supports exporting server metrics via the `/api/metrics` endpoint in the text-based
Prometheus exposition format, allowing you to see server analytics and trendlines using a
Prometheus/Grafana stack.

The `/api/metrics` endpoint is disabled by default. To enable this feature, go to the "Global 
Settings" configuration and toggle on "Enable Metrics". Then, restart the server.

Supported metrics include:

* Number of total archives and workers
* Number of requests handled and total request handling duration for a given endpoint and worker
* CPU, memory and file-descriptor statistics
* Miscellaneous server info (version, version name)
