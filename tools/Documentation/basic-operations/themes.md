# 🖌 Themes

The front-end interface of LANraragi is customizable out of the box through CSS.\
A few themes are built-in already. Theme Preference is saved on a per-user basis.

To change Theme, click the matching button on the footer of every page.\
You can write your own themes by modifying the existing ones - Dropping them in the _/public/themes_ folder will make them selectable by anyone.

For users who don't have access to the app folder and want to make custom themes, your only option currently is to use a custom CSS browser extension.\
Docker users can try binding a folder on their machine to the _/home/koyomi/lanraragi/public/themes_ folder.
