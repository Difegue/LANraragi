## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

* Please open an **issue** in the Issues tab.
* Use a clear **title** and describe:

  * What you expected vs. what happened
  * Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
  * Environment (OS, Perl version, browser, CLI vs Docker, etc.)
  * Logs or error output (if any)
* Feel free to propose a **solution** or **rough sketch** for feature requests, but it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre only describing the need.

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure your fork is up-to-date with the upstream `dev` (or main development) branch.
2. Create a new branch, named descriptively (e.g. `fix-duplicate-scan`, `add-opds-filtering`).
3. Make your changes, and **rebase / squash** as appropriate before opening a PR.
4. Include tests (if relevant) and/or manual steps to verify your change.
5. In your PR description:

   * Summarize what the change does and why
   * Reference any related issues (e.g. ‚ÄúFixes #123‚Äù)
   * List any dependencies or side-effects

### Code Review & Feedback

* Be responsive to review comments; sometimes the maintainers may ask for minor adjustments.
* If you disagree with a suggested change, discuss it kindly.
* Upon approval, the maintainer will merge your PR.
* Merged PRs (or donations) are eligible to receive the project‚Äôs **sticker pack**. (Details in the README.)

### Testing

* Whenever possible, add or update test cases to cover your changes.
* Run existing tests to ensure nothing breaks.
* For web / UI changes, provide screenshots or short video/gif demos (optional but helpful).
* Document manual testing steps, especially for features that are hard to automate.

### Translations & Localization

* We use Weblate for translation management (see README).
* If you submit translations manually, prefer format and encoding consistent with existing locale files.
* For new languages, create locale files following existing structure.

### Documentation

* Documentation should be kept up-to-date (README, docs, wiki).
* When adding a feature, please document:

  * Configuration options
  * API endpoints (if any)
  * Behavior changes
  * Sample usage
* Prefer clear, concise prose and examples.

### Plugins & Extensions

* LANraragi supports plugins ‚Äî contributions in this area are welcome.
* Follow the plugin API contracts and include sample usage or tests.
* Document plugin dependencies, version compatibility, and security implications.

---

## Style Guidelines

* Follow existing style and conventions in the codebase.
* Perl: adhere to `perlcritic` and `perltidy` configurations already present.
* JavaScript / CSS / frontend: follow linting rules (ESLint, style formatting) as configured.
* Keep lines reasonably short (e.g. ‚â§ 100 characters) unless clarity requires otherwise.
* Write clear comments, but avoid redundant or obvious comments.

---

## Commit Message Format

We encourage the following structure for commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<More detailed description ‚Äî what, why, how>

References: #<issue-number>, #<other-related-issues>
```

* **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
* **scope**: optional, part of system affected (e.g. `reader`, `api`, `plugin`)
* Short summary: imperative mood, ‚â§ 50 characters
* Body lines: wrap at ~72 characters

Example:

```
feat(api): support filtering by tag namespace

Add a new query parameter `ns:` to allow filtering entries
by tag namespace in OPDS requests.

Fixes #456
```

---

## Branching & Versioning

* The **dev** branch is the primary development branch; PRs should target it unless otherwise noted.
* Major and minor version releases are tagged (e.g. `v0.9.5`).
* For bugfixes, branch from `dev` (or hotfix branches, if applicable) and merge back into `dev`.
* Keep your branches focused ‚Äî small, single-purpose changes are easier to review.

## Thank You & Recognition

Contributors (past and present) are listed in the project's contributors page.
Merged pull requests (and donations above a threshold) may also receive a **sticker pack** as a token of gratitude (details in README).
