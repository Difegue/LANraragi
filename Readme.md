![Demo(fuck das lewd)!](http://a.pomf.se/opzrwv.jpg "")
Web interface and reader for a server-stored directory of comics (as zip archives).  
Supports tags, and runs on a basic installation of Perl(with HTML:Tables and Archive::Zip installed).  
![No Databases!](http://a.pomf.se/okalua.png "") (almost)

To-be UI and project mostly inspired by the good folks over at sadpanda, and the Wani takedowns. ;_;7

Note that this is a rather simple project and is only meant to be a frontend to an archive, if you're looking for a non-Web, non-Server solution I'd recommend [the Hydrus suite](http://github.com/hydrusnetwork).
(Which has also the benefit of being way more advanced.)
