Web interface and reader for storage of comics/manga on NAS, running on Perl/Redis/unar with a dash of Imagemagick.

## Please Read

For the upcoming 0.5, we're moving at incredibly hihg speed, resulting in a somewhat unstable master branch at times.  
If you want to download a somewhat stable version, you can try version [0.4](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/releases/tag/v.0.4.0) with the [matching old documentation](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/blob/oldcgi/tools/LRR_CGI_Documentation.zip), but know that you'll probably have to reinstall everything to update.  

## Features  

* Stores your comics in archive format. (zip/rar/targz/lzma/7z/xz/cbz/cbr supported)  

* Read archives directly from your web browser: they're extracted automatically when you want to read them, and deleted when you're done. 

* Two different user interfaces : compact archive list with thumbnails-on-hover, or thumbnail view.

* Choose from 5 preinstalled responsive library styles, or add your own with CSS.      

* Tag support: Add your own or import them from predefined sources.  

* Batch Tagging available for tagging multiple archives in one go.

* Backup your database as JSON to carry your tags over to another LANraragi instance.
